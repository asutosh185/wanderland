                                <p class="comment more">I am an avid reader, although not really of business books, even though I own two businesses. I would never go seeking a business book in the management section of a book store or Amazon and I don’t have a lot of free time to squander on something I don’t enjoy — my clear preference is novels, which let me escape from the trials of owning a business.</br>However, through my networking circle, a book was recommended to me: “Leadership in Wonderland.” I was surprised at how entertaining it was and how relevant it was for me – it increased my appreciation for my staff and made me curious about whether we could incorporate their hobbies and skills into some of our client projects. I've had my core team for 15, 18, and 22 years, so after a while you forget that they've developed and changed over time just as you have, and that everyone's roles in the business should be re-evaluated in that context. Reading the book opened up new ideas, new ways of servicing clients. We’ll see where this takes us. Meanwhile, the book was really fun.

                                <p class="comment more">Delightfully charming. This book provides an entrepreneurial story written as a fictional tale about Alice in Wonderland who struggles with her new business, Leaves-of-Wonderland, Purveyor of Fine Teas. As the owner and CEO of a new company, Alice has many struggles. </br>
                                To begin with, she does not know who to trust. She is uncertain and flat out ignorant about needing to mature, and she falls short in the area of being able to make the necessary changes to make good progress. She also struggles with distractions, quick to blame other animals, and she responds with childish anger as well as being impatient. Alice needs to become more knowledgeable in customer service instead of reacting defensively. Most of the chapters are amusing, but all of the chapters end with a helpful lesson in leadership for the reader to consider. In addition, each chapter ends with discussion questions that book clubs might find worth exploring as a group. Poor Alice faces adversity from all directions including disloyal employees, gossip, jealousy, mismanagement, and internal conflict. Finally, reality sets in when someone who is having a dream wakes up. Problems are best seen as opportunities to be solved. I like the advice on seeking good consultation and remembering to celebrate success. Great ending. I like the way this book provides a place for personal application.
                                </br>Business owners and mature people who have already learned many life lessons will find this book especially amusing because Alice is tossed to and fro in a world of creatures where she must either decide to let the shortcomings of other people and her own shortcomings bring her down or she can step up as a leader to provide solutions and aim for an environment that will bring forth much needed growth. My guess is that this book can also be good for people who genuinely want to learn more about what not to do as an entrepreneur. Alice has made many mistakes, but she finds a way to bounce back from them by learning how to become a better leader. It has been said that those who are the most successful are the ones who have made the most mistakes and learned from them. I like the quote, “Winners never quit, and quitters never win.” It isn’t the person who makes the most mistakes that wins, it’s the person who has the courage to learn from mistakes and not give up that wins. Leadership must have a sense of direction where others will follow. In addition to leadership, entrepreneurials will need business skills such as accounting, marketing, and legal advice. Little Alice has a lot to learn!</p>

Although I may not yet be in a leadership position in my career, I could relate personally to the story from my experience in grad school class government: trying to develop conversations between different grad school programs, students and professors.</br> It takes more than charm and passion – you must try to understand and be willing to listen to different points of view to come up with a collaborative solution. Normally, I wouldn’t be reading a management book after recently finishing a demanding graduate school program; I’d rather read something light or that directly relates to my field. However, once I started “Leadership in Wonderland” and it brought back lessons I learned in graduate school government without realizing it at the time – and in such an engaging way, using the characters from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland – it was not only fun but supportive. It made me recognize that I still have much to learn, and helped me feel optimistic about my future.

We all understand what it’s like to be a newcomer to a group, have to build trust, make our own individual mark, and lead a group which needs to be led. Along the way, in Alice’s journey, as the workbook develops our own journey, we learn how to problem-solve in continually new territory. It’s the perfect analogy to hone the skills that will be needed for the business future to come.</p>

By carefully disguising all the fears you have as belonging to the main character, you're given incredibly clever advice without having to admit you didn't know enough to ask any of the "right" questions. </br>
                                There are so many excellent suggestions it's hard to choose just a few. My favorites include not expecting yourself to be perfect in everything, owning up to your shortcomings and asking for help. Another is it's okay to be afraid of change, but you have to realize change is necessary for growth. It's not possible to run away from reality, painful though it may be. Courage isn't a lack of fear; it's doing that which scares you in spite of the fear. Sometimes faking confidence will help you feel confident. The first step in solving problems is a belief they can be solved. Dwelling in the past will not solve today's problems. Growth is a journey, not a destination. Self-motivation and sense of self comes from within. They are necessary for growth. If you are always seeking confirmation and acknowledgement from others, you become dependent upon them and miss the opportunity to trust yourself to make decisions.
                                </br>There is so much more to be learned from this book without the tedium and self-flagellation that accompanies so many self-help books. I hope you enjoy the journey as much as I did!</p>

This book deftly and cleverly does just that, using the well-known protagonist of Alice and putting her on the journey that transforms her into a leader.</br>While reading this book and answering the thought-provoking questions in the companion workbook, I was either reflecting on my own experiences or actively thinking about what I might do if placed in Alice's situation.
                               </br>This book refreshingly presents leadership concepts in a non-prescriptive manner, inviting the reader to decide what they think of Alice's journey and which leadership philosophies they should personally adopt. An entertaining and thoughtful read from beginning to end.</p>

A testament to what's important for one to become a smart, savvy leader.</br> I only wish this kind of book was available when I was climbing through the ranks after my college days. It really affords one the opportunity to understand what's necessary for leadership.</p>

Instead, through a delightful way of looking at different personalities this book offers different perspectives of effective leadership. </br>One model does not fit all. This book is great as a solo read or to spark conversations within a small group learning environment.</p>
