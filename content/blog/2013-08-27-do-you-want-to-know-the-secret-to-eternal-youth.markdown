Of course you do! We all do…okay, everyone over the age of 30 wants to know the secret of eternal youth.

It’s curiosity. Curiosity leads to learning. Learning keeps you young.

Ta da!

That’s why back-to-school-time is so special. It reminds us that we need to keep moving forward, never be complacent – ask questions and learn.

As Alice goes on her _odyssey_, she has plenty of learning opportunities. Many of them take her far out of her comfort zone, but when she is open to them, she can feel herself grow.

Remember that feeling of getting ready to go back to school in the fall? Do you remember that mixture of apprehension and excitement? We’ve all felt it. Even when we start a new job, there is that feeling that maybe we won’t be good enough combined with the thrill of a new opportunity. Like Alice, when we accept the challenge, we have these wonderful growth spurts.

There are a few employees in Alice’s company who need to go back to school: Griffon and Mock Turtle are her would-be legal eagles if they could just pass _The Nest_ – the bar every lawyer must pass on the way to work; and Puppy, the over-exuberant, but untrained Manager of Manufacturing. Even though they have a lot to learn, they are excited about the opportunity to contribute.

We hope you will take the time to savor this special time of year and give yourself the gift of life-long learning. Aren’t we fortunate to have the ability to learn and grow?
