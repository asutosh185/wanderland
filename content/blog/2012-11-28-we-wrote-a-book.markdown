“I wrote a book!”

Doesn’t that have a nice ring? Who wouldn’t want to be able to make that claim? I’ve known that I had a book in me for many years. The only problem was that I wanted people to want to read it and I couldn’t quite figure out how to create something unique and meaningful.

Like Susan, I’m not a huge fan of most business books. For one thing I have a short attention span. That’s why I can be reading a perfectly fine book that some subject matter expert put in countless hours to craft, when I find that my mind wandering off in search of  some other diversion. This is not to say that I haven’t benefited from reading leadership/business books. I have, and so have my clients with whom I share the knowledge that I gain from them.

But what I wanted to share with the world was something different. What that ‘something’ was I couldn’t quite define. And that is why I decided to write a novel rather than concentrate on a business book. It was one of the best experiences that I have ever had. It was liberating! It was fun! It sparked a deeper level of creativity in me than I knew existed. As other writers have reported, my characters took on a life of their own. They took me in directions that I hadn’t planned, and taught me things about myself that surprised me.

So, when Susan and I began dancing around the idea of writing a book, I was ready for the challenge. Through the process, I believe that she and I have learned more than either of us could possibly have imagined. Indeed, we continue to learn with every encounter with Alice and company. It has been an incredible gift that has made me a better trainer, coach and consultant. Who knew that our characters would be such fine teachers?! Our hope is that others benefit from Alice and her journey as much as we did.
PS...About the photo: Last time Susan shared a picture of the world from her perspective. This time it is a picture of my world.
