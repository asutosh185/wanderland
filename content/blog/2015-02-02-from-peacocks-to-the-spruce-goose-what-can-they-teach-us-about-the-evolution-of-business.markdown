I recently had the very good fortune of interviewing[ BJ Gallagher](http://www.bjgallagher.com/), best-selling author of Peacock in the Land of Penguins ([Berrett-Koehler](http://www.bkconnection.com/)), for Women’s Voices Magazine ([click here to see article](http://bit.ly/1uQcNCk%20)). The book, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary, is one of my favorites because it delivers a great message in such a delightful manner.

At the heart of the book is Perry Peacock, a colorful bird who is hired by a company of penguins that think he will breathe new life into their organization. After a short time there, however, it became apparent to all that Perry was never going to be a match. The penguins only thought they wanted a bird of a different feather. As much as they encouraged him to change to be more penguin-like, the more Perry felt out of place.[![plpcover20th2](https://wonderlandodyssey.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/plpcover20th2.jpg)](https://wonderlandodyssey.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/plpcover20th2.jpg)
During my conversation with BJ, I began to think about Alice and her team at Leaves-of-Wonderland: is she a penguin? I came to the conclusion that she isn’t – she truly values diversity. After all, she has rabbits, mice, a caterpillar and a variety of other creatures, including a penguin, working for her. Additionally, she learns to value diversity of thought as she grows.

But what about other notable organizations? Do companies, which were started by peacocks, and other exotic birds, lose the creativity that once put them on the cutting edge? For Alice, as her company grew, she found it to be too much of a ‘grown up’ endeavor. She wanted that playful creativity that had captured her imagination. Do other companies fall into that same trap?

I started my career at what was once Hughes Helicopters. We occupied the buildings Howard Hughes had frequented just a few years earlier. The Spruce Goose was built on that site, and remnants remained if you knew where to look. There was a sense of his presence everywhere on the property. His spirit of invention and creativity was still alive, in my opinion, even after we became part of McDonnell Douglas. It was what inspired me and allowed me to thrive as a peacock. However, the company like so many others, continued to morph, and was ultimately swallowed by a competitor.

Is is normal for organizations to become more ‘penguin oriented’ - that is more interested in conformity – the further they are from the founders, who are very often peacocks in their own right?

“What would be interesting,” says BJ, “is if we watched organizations such as Apple Computer. Now, Steve Jobs just died a few years ago. He was certainly a peacock of peacocks and prided himself on establishing a peacock organization. I haven't been to Apple in a long time, and I'm wondering if they can maintain their peacock culture or if they too will sort of gradually morph into penguins and then die as they become more invested in the status quo.”

Apple seems to be doing exceedingly well as financial news recently confirmed. Will they be able to keep from becoming a land of penguins? And what about other companies we typically associate with being ‘out of the box thinkers’?

“Even the most peacock organizations have a little penguin in them and vice versa,” says BJ. “But I wonder if it is possible to maintain [the peacock mentality after the founder is gone]. I'm thinking of Google and Facebook. I don't know. I guess time will tell.”

In my next post, I will share more of my conversation with BJ and her thoughts on organizational evolution.
