For the next few installments we bring you something novel: _Characters Magazine_, along with celebrity journalist, _Mark Cohiba_, entrepreneur and supporter of entrepreneurs, interview our own Alice Liddell from _“The Wonderland Odyssey, Turning Leadership on its Hat”_.  Here’s the first part of the interview!

C:  Welcome, Alice.
A:  Thank you, Mark.  I am honored to be together here with you considering all you’ve done as a business owner and entrepreneur.
C:  Thank you, Alice, however, we are really here to talk about you.  Alice, you are about to become very popular, yourself.  You started your business, “Leaves-of-Wonderland” when you were just a little girl, after falling down a rabbit hole.  And now with the publishing of your further adventures, _“The Wonderland Odyssey: Turning Leadership on its Hat”, _you are about to become the _“It” _girl of literature, social media, and business.  
A:  Thank you, Mark.  I have a habit of belittling my accomplishments.  I am trying to change.  It seems I’m still a little stuck in my old way of thinking about myself.
C:  I see. Is that why you are sporting new eyeglasses to change your image?
A:  Precisely!  I am so glad you noticed!  Do you like them?
C:  Definitely!
A:  Oh, I am so glad!  All the folks I look up to the most and who have helped me wear eyeglasses. Beaver, Caterpillar, R.S., those two authors, Rebecca and Susan, who wrote about my adventures.  I was hoping to gain some of their insight to help me out of my challenges and to change my view of things.
C:  I thought it was because eyeglasses are the accessory of the moment!
A:  Are they?
C:  Never mind, I can see that they are not a fashion statement for you.  So, are they working?
A:  Well, time will tell.
C:  Well, Alice, that’s not very telling.  You’re about to become the young woman that all women secretly yearn to be, _Characters Magazine _needs something more scandalous, more ripe for gossip than that.  So, let’s change the subject….
