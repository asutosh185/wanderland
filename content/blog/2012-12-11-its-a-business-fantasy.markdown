It’s a business book!

It’s a fantasy!

Wait. You’re both right. It’s two, two, two books in one! (Homage to Double Mint Gum for those of you who may think that simply I neglected to edit.)

Yes, there is now a new genre “Business Fantasy”…. Or is it a “Leadership Fantasy”?

As we mentioned in our earlier posts, Susan and I are not big fans of the typical “business book,” and we figure that there are a lot of other people out there who are like us. We set out to write a book that would fill the gap between business related books and fun fiction by providing interesting, valuable learning objectives neatly disguised as a children's tale.

Clearly, this new genre isn’t for everyone. If you crave bullet points, a table of contents that reads like a syllabus, and a tidy index accompanied by appropriate citations, you may not enjoy our business fantasy. On the other hand, if you can watch a movie such as The Godfather or the Beautician and the Beast and find the leadership learning points you are going to love Wonderland Odyssey: Turning Leadership on its Hat.
