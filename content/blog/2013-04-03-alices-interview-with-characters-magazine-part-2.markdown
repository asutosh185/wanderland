Last week we featured the first installment of the interview of Alice Liddell, owner of Leaves-of-Wonderland: Purveyor of Fine Teas, by Mark Cohiba contributor to "Characters" magazine. Below is our 2nd installment of the interview:

C: OK Alice, it’s time for you to dish…What is the most dastardly character that you have had to deal with?

A: Oh, Mark, you really do want scandal, don’t you. Well, I take the 5th on that. If you’ve read my story, you know who I’ve had run ins with.

C: You are referring to Mad Hatter and the Queen of Hearts?

A: I refuse to name names. I don’t think that would be very beneficial to the company at this point.

C: Fair enough…But our readers would love to know why Susan and Rebecca selected you as the subject of their book. After all, there are lots of young entrepreneurs who they could have featured.

A: (Laughing) True, but how many of those young entrepreneurs have had such a crazy ride as I have? Seriously Mark, I think it was because I wanted my story told in case it could help someone else overcome their own obstacles.

C: You were just a kid when you started Leaves-of-Wonderland, your very cool tea company. What was your biggest challenge?

A: I was my biggest challenge. Jeez Mark, I was so immature and headstrong…always a great combination. I was also very insecure, and I was afraid to ask for help. Luckily, I got over that or we probably wouldn’t be having this conversation.

C: Why is that?

A: If I hadn’t had the help of Penguin, Caterpillar, Beaver and a host of other characters, Leaves-of-Wonderland would have gone down the drain. My insecurity made me think that I needed to have all the answers. Then some very wise individuals pointed out that no one can do it all on their own.

C: That’s very interesting. I think that most people look at leaders and think that they have all the answers.

A: That’s what I thought, and boy was I wrong! The sign of a good leader isn’t knowing the answers. Its knowing the right questions and surrounding yourself with smart people who can provide the answers.

C: I must say Alice, it looks as though you have done a great job at that.

A: Thank you Mark, but it is an area that I continue to work at. My coaches see to that.

C: Alice, our readers want to know, what has happened with that naughty company that was trying to steal Leaves-of-Wonderland’s identity?

(Stay tuned for our next installment of the interview. Do you have questions you would like for Mark to ask Alice? If so, leave them in the comments section.)
