One of Alice’s leadership best leadership attributes is her willingness and ability to surround
herself with a diverse team. Among her team members she has Penguin, White Rabbit, Magpie,
Puppy and a whole zoo full of personalities.

Not only are they different species, they represent a diversity of thought. This is a gift that
benefits any organization or society, but can seem difficult, if not controversial to some. This
time of the year, different ways of thinking or believing can be especially challenging for some
and beautiful for others.

We hope everyone has a lovely holiday, and want to share an article and photograph from
Women’s Voices Magazine by Larry Lacy, which puts our sentiments into words. To read the
