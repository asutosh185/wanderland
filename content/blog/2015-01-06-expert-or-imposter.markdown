Marcus Mumford was asked to join a bunch of seasoned musicians, including Elvis Costello and T Bone Burnett, to write and record music to Bob Dylan’s lyrics that were dated 1967, but had never been used.  The whole process was recorded in a 2014 documentary currently airing on Showtime called “Lost Songs: The Basement Tapes Continued”.  The Directors are Carol Cohen and Sam Jones.

A poignant portion of the documentary features Marcus separating from the rest of the musicians because he did not feel worthy to be writing music to Dylan lyrics, particularly among the other talent that had been collected, along with the pressure of writing music within a small timeframe. The other musicians were surprised by his apprehension of sharing, although they honored his space and emotions. Elvis Costello felt he was being very self-critical.  How come Marcus didn’t seem to feel worthy of being given this project? He wasn’t the only young musician included and the others didn’t have the degree of acclaim that he did. Gradually, as Marcus starts to share music he has just written with the others, and they ask for his input on their compositions, his confidence reappears along with some tears of accomplishment.

Are you familiar with Marcus?  Mumford & Sons led by Marcus Mumford at lead vocals, guitar, drums and mandolin has been awarded countless awards and recognition for his work:  Billboard Music Awards, Brit Awards, Grammys, Juno awards and Q awards.  Not for insignificant categories, but for International Album of the Year, Album of the Year, Top Rock Album and Top Alternative Album.  The band has recorded with Ray Davies of the Kinks and appeared on “Later… with Jools Holland”.  Marcus, from all appearances writes all or most of the songs.

Knowing this, does it surprise you that someone of Marcus’ stature could ever feel unworthy or perhaps like an imposter among a group of experts, even though some are peers?

In “Leadership in Wonderland” even though Alice had founded and launched a company, she had not managed it for an interim period.  When she returned to the troubled company to turn it around, she didn’t know whether she had the right education, experience and gravitas to lead it. She experienced the same feelings and circumstances as Marcus Mumford. Also like Marcus she was brave enough to admit it and then learned, as he did, that it’s a natural feeling and it can be overcome by not remaining frozen, but by working through it - by just doing. They both were able to get beyond their initial fear.

Would you ever admit that sometimes you may have a moment when even though you are the expert on a subject, you don’t feel like you are worthy of receiving the attention of an expert? If so, how do you alter your mindset so you can move forward?
