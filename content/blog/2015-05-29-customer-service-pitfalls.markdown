Once I visited a business where the employees had been trained in customer service. One of their tricks was to say "my pleasure" in response when someone thanked them. The only problem was they really didn't look like it was their pleasure. In fact, they often looked as though they had eaten something sour.Consequently, I couldn't help toying with them, thanking them as often as possible in order to elicit a robotic 'thank you'. The owner had good intentions when he trained his employees. What he didn't realize is that the words alone didn't create a culture of customer care.

Another example of employees using rote phrases as instructed, without having any understanding of how they apply to customer service showed itself a couple weeks ago at a large chain store. I was looking for several items, one of which I couldn't find. When I was checking out, the cashier asked if I had found everything. When I said I hadn't, she simply said, "Oh." A lost opportunity for customer service - for achieving customer satisfaction that was lost forever.

What is the point of teaching employees to ask the question if you don't teach them how to respond to the answer? And what about the person waiting on that customer? I've worked in retail, and even co-owned a store, so I have a good understanding of all that workers have to put up with. With that said, isn't the employer doing them a disservice by only providing part of the training? Perhaps they ASSUME that if the answer to "Did you find everything you were looking for?" is no, that the employee would have the common sense to ask a follow up question. That, obviously, is a big assumption.

We would love to hear your input on this topic.
