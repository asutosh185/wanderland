_“Now, young lady, we suggest that you leave this establishment,” stated Gryphon in a manner that indicated that it really wasn’t a suggestion as much as a directive._

_“I will when I’m good and ready, and I’m neither good nor ready,” responded Alice causing the two Attorneys at Law to take a step back. They were quite unused to anyone questioning them since interrogation was their responsibility, and the right with which they had been endowed by virtue of their impressive diplomas.  As they stood before her uncharacteristically speechless, Alice asked them, “Do you know who I am?”_

_Regaining some of their composure, the two took turns throwing out a barrage of questions in response to Alice’s: “Who do you think you are?”, “Why should we care who you are if you don’t know yourself?”, “What business is it of yours who we think you are?”, “When was the last time you knew who you are?”, “Do you have a subpoena requiring us to answer that question?”, and finally, “Has anyone suggested that we should know who you are?”_

At times, I scratch my head.  I wonder what people are thinking.  I wonder if they are thinking.  Do they realize how they come across?

Do you ever think about those individuals you meet in business who don’t have a clue about how they are being perceived?  Because if they had a clue they wouldn’t behave the way they do.  They would word things differently.  Use a different tone of voice.  They would listen.  They would respond to questions and cues.

I seem to find a trend of these folks who work in the publicity, PR, legal, marketing and sales fields: people businesses.   You know the types?  They are in their own universe where everyone outside isn’t as smart or qualified.  They talk down to others.  They belittle others’ thoughts, ideas, and questions.  They discourage others and are often towers of negativity.   

Would you want to work with one of these people?  Would you recommend them?   And if you told them how they come across, would they want to change?

I had a conversation with such a person who is a publicist.  He is supposed to be a very successful one, at least according to the internet.  However, he is his own worst advertisement.  I wouldn’t want to trust my business to someone who rather than being my cheerleader or respond to my questions, would instead tell me everything that was wrong with my business or my personality.   I didn’t ask for his opinion, had I had wanted that, I am direct - I would have asked for that.  What I did want is an answer to my question and I never got it.

Maybe that’s the problem, I just don’t get it.  I don’t understand these business folk.  Maybe their audience and clientele want to be insulted.  Maybe that’s what they pay them for.   I guess I am just not their cup of tea.  And they are not mine.
