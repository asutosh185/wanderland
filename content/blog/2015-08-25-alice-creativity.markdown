Multi-talented musician and composer [Ibrahim Maalouf](http://www.ibrahimmaalouf.com/) says he has always loved the story of 'Alice in Wonderland' because it's all about the freedom to imagine. To prove his point, he collaborated with artist [Oxmo Puccino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxmo_Puccino) to re-imagine the story as a hip-hop opera set in modern France*.

That's the beauty of Alice - she's as relevant today as she was 150 years ago - continuing to spark the imagination of people all over the world.

Creativity was a major factor in choosing Alice when we decided to write a leadership book. When your mind has the opportunity to be creative and play, it is easier to learn and apply what you learn. Thus, Leadership in Wonderland.

When I was in grad school, I never really liked learning the 'prescriptions' - do this now do that - which so many text books offered. What I liked was learning the principles and having a case study in which to apply what I had learned, coupled with my own knowledge and insights. It was much more beneficial to my learning experience than an exam!

It is that same concept we offer in Leadership in Wonderland: We provide some principles, cunningly disguised as a fun story, then offer an opportunity for the reader to use her creativity to insert what she has learned into her own situation. What you learn most likely will be different from the next person.

Does this appeal to you?

*After you leave us a comment to tell us what you think of our concept, be sure to listen to the concert '[Au pay d'Alice](http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-08-24/reimagining-alice-wonderland-hip-hop-opera).'
