It’s difficult when you’ve been writing a book for a year and you’ve become attached to the characters, the plot, the wording, the title, to change anything about it.   If someone suggests a different wording, character, or title, you take it personally. It’s as if someone doesn’t like the way you are raising your child, someone is annoyed by the way your dog conducts himself; the book is your baby and no one has the right to inform you what to do about that baby. Unless….

Yes, unless that person is a publisher or an agent, and therefore is an expert in the world you are trying to gain entry into.  That person has valuable insight into making your book a reality.  In that case, you pay attention because any feedback is few and far between and yet is also potentially valuable. It could mean the difference between being published and talking about being published.  And when two agents strongly dislike your title because they find it confusing and unmarketable, and suggest another title that is simple, rolls off the tongue, and is also fun, then you listen.  And you change it.  Goodbye “Wonderland Odyssey, Turning Leadership on its Hat” and hello “Leadership in Wonderland”.

And so our next chapter begins…..
