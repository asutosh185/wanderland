<blockquote>_...Seeing the unhappy look on her face, Penguin asked Alice, “What is bothering you? You look as though you feel unwell.”_

Alice did look a bit unwell at that. “I’m afraid,” she said.

“Afraid? Of what are you afraid?” asked Penguin the concern clearly evident in his voice.

“I’m afraid that I don’t like what I see.” Now with her newly improved vision, she could clearly see that Penguin didn’t understand her, so she explained. “I see that I am a big part of the problem in the company, and I don’t like that. I don’t quite understand what I’m doing wrong, so I surely cannot do things correctly.</blockquote>


from "Legal Eagles" Chapter 9 of "The Wonderland Odyssey: Turning Leadership on its Hat"

A Classic Twist on the MBA Martini

Give a French Literature major an MBA education, have her live and breathe in the business world, and she co-writes a book about leadership that she certainly never read in her MBA studies, nor has she found in any bookstore.  She writes a business book, not based on anecdotes from her client cases, not based on an esoteric new model of strategic methodology, but based on a classic piece of literature, furthermore, (gasp),  children’s literature that’s beloved by all ages and backgrounds. 

You saw this coming, but then again, maybe you didn’t:   that French Literature major, that’s me,…… or rather, that’s Rebecca.   Well… it’s both of us. Coincidentally, and we just discovered this today well after finishing the writing of “The Wonderland Odyssey, Turning Leadership on its Hat”, that this describes BOTH Rebecca and my background.  Perhaps, there is a slight difference: Rebecca changed her undergraduate major from French to Public Administration.  But, the similarities just keep on coming.

Why should you care about this?  Maybe you shouldn’t, however, The Economist and Ken Starkey, a professor at Nottingham University Business School certainly do.  And the new dean of Harvard Business School does as well.  They publish, write or profess that the typical MBA leader from recent years is not equipped to handle the challenges of today’s business world when bravado or confidence alone can’t seem to answer the questions asked of them; their consensus is the education of the recent MBA graduate is not broad enough and that subjects and emphasis should be expanded to better enable the MBA to be more flexible, strategic or enlightened enough to delegate.  One of their solutions is to teach the classics.  [http://www.economist.com/whichmba/academic-view-new-philosophy-leadership?fsrc=scn/ln_ec/academic_view_a_new_philosophy_of_leadership](http://www.economist.com/whichmba/academic-view-new-philosophy-leadership?fsrc=scn/ln_ec/academic_view_a_new_philosophy_of_leadership)

Rebecca and I, well, we’ll just  “educate” by entertaining and having a starting point of the classics.
