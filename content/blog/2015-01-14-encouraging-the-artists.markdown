Our last blog spoke about “The Lost Songs: The Basement Tapes Continued”, a musical documentary appearing on on the Showtime network,  and specifically, Marcus Mumford and his challenges about writing music for the collected artists involved in the supreme musical collaboration.  This week, we also devote to “The Lost Songs”, but instead we focus on “the Alice” in the documentary, the collaborative leader:  T Bone Burnett.

T Bone speaks to the camera in one segment of the film and explains that he is the not his usual self, the person who gets tied up in the detail of every note on a recording. Instead, his role is to create an environment where the musicians can feel free and experiment, like in the original “Basement Tapes” of Bob Dylan and The Band.  He doesn’t want the individuals to feel self-conscious.  He wants them to have fun.  As Taylor Goldsmith puts it “T Bone has a great way with people.” He keeps everyone smiling, laughing and feeling inspired. T Bone wants to “get the best out of people and not let anyone get discouraged”. Taylor alludes earlier in the film, how sadly this kind of approach doesn’t happen in music production anymore, and it’s a shame.

Alice plays T Bone Burnett in “Leadership in Wonderland”. She wants to create an environment at the company, Leaves-of-Wonderland, so that all the employees feel like they have a hand in making the business better. She starts out as the former T Bone persona and develops into the leader who encourages communication, appreciation and inspiration.

You may not be in the music business or a creature in Wonderland, however…….When was the last time you were involved in a supportive group effort and in which you were encouraged to create something and have fun?
