Camouflage.  Things that seem to be one thing ….and then are another.  Things that wear a disguise.  Like Charms Blow Pops or Tootsie Roll Lollipops:  are they lollipops or something else?  Clark Kent: is he a journalist or a super hero?  Is it just a leaf or is something else there?

And then, there’s “The Wonderland Odyssey”.    “The Wonderland Odyssey” reads like a story book, an adventure with a slight mystery.  Alice along with eye-glasses and a magnifying glass. Oh, but, it’s so much more than that!  It’s a book that educates potential entrepreneurs, students and creative’s without SCREAMING “this is how to do this”.  In fact, it’s up to you to figure out what you will experience and how you will learn from the book.  It’s all up to you, if you choose to work with the primer or not, and what questions or chapter will inspire you to think differently about your own experiences and the experiences yet to come.

When was the last time you were surprised by an unexpected pleasure inside something else?
