In his ground-breaking book _Corporate Lifecycles: How Organizations Grow and Die and What to Do About it_, Dr. Ichak Adizes helps readers understand the natural path that organizations tend to take from infancy to death.

We’ve seen the practical side of this at numerous companies. Yet, each organization likes to think that they are different – that they don’t fit the mold. They like to think that even if they are unwilling or unable to change to keep pace with the marketplace, the world will see the error of its way and come crawling back to them.

Sorry kids. That’s just not the way things work. You don’t have to believe us. You don’t have to believe Dr. Adizes. All you have to do is study history…or Buddha

“The Buddha said everything is impermanent. Everything will die. Everything will disappear, will disintegrate. We get upset about it as if it shouldn't be so,” offers BJ Gallagher, author of _[Being Buddha At Work](http://http://www.amazon.com/Being-Buddha-Work-Ancient-Success/dp/1609942922) told me during _my interview with her for [_Women’s Voices Magazine_](http://http://www.womensvoicesmagazine.com/2015/02/01/whats-the-difference-between-the-golden-rule-the-platinum-rule/#.VM7DCy7G8VQ). “Buddha would say everything is impermanent. Don't cling to things. Everything is transitory. So, when you cling to it, you create your own suffering.”

If you look at the companies that you grew up with, many of them are gone or only the brand exists, but as a part of another entity.

For example, there was a time when Compaq was one of the biggest computer sellers. However, in the world of survival of the fittest, they were devoured by HP. Another well-known company that bit the dust was TWA. After 70 years in business, they were consumed by American Airlines. Arthur Anderson, one of the Big 5 accounting firms surrendered their licenses to practice as CPAs after 90 years in business as a result of their involvement with Enron.

My personal experience was with McDonnell Douglas, a company that was a pioneer in the aircraft industry. Heck they even had a ride at Disneyland. But the company disappeared when it became part of Boeing after several losing several major contracts in a short period of time.

“I went through this with the newspaper business because as you know, the Peacock book is written about the LA Times,” says BJ. “I was just having a conversation the other day with one of the editors who works at my publishing company. He was lamenting that he found a study about the low percentage of people who buy books and read books. I thought to myself it sounds like the newspaper business all over again.

“His question was, ‘How do we reverse this trend?’ I said, ‘I'm not sure that's the right question to ask. Maybe the question is how do we ride the trend so that we're successful? In my experience you don't turn those trends around. The trends have a life of their own.

“The railroad went through the same thing. They fell out of favor because they thought they were in the railroad business and they weren’t. They are in the transportation business. If newspapers and book publishers think they are in the newspaper or book business they're doomed. But if they think they're in the information business, then that's a whole different ballgame. “

How do you define the business you’re in? Will that definition stand the test of time, allowing you to be flexible – to change to meet the needs of your customers?
