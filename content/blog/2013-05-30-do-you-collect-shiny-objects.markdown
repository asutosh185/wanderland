_[Alice] waited. There was no response. She tried again this time a little louder. Again, she waited and still got no response from the HR department. After waiting for a reasonable amount of time - she was trying to be careful, patient and polite - she pulled the door open a crack and peered with one eye at what lay behind the door. “Hello?” She couldn’t see anyone. She opened the door a little more to have a better view. There was no one there. “Maybe I should wait inside for the HR representative to return.” And that’s just what she did. She entered the HR home and sat down on what looked like the right place to plant herself. And she waited._

_While she waited she took a keen look at her surroundings. “Why it seems to be built like a nest with twigs and string, paper, pencils, and leaves. There are a lot of shiny things here too. Let’s see, there are bells and whistles. There are coins, medallions, and bright ribbons. Someone here certainly collects sparkly things!”_

Some people are always in pursuit of the next “shiny thing” that will help them cure whatever ails them and/or their company. Some look for the perfect solution to make more money or how to look 10 pounds thinner without dieting. Most people eventually find that these purported fast and easy solutions don’t work, but that doesn’t dissuade them from trying the next shiny thing that comes along with promises to make life better in some fashion. Unfortunately, their quest often again ends in disappointment. Is there a solution?

In Wonderland Odyssey, Magpie, the director of Human Resources, feels abandoned and misused. Her solution? To surround herself with as many shiny things as possible. Just like the rest of us, however, Magpie finds that they only mask the symptoms – providing her with a temporary ‘fix,’ but in the long run only serve to remind her of the fact that nothing has changed to make the situation better.

In real life, people read books, hire consultants, buy DVD’s or invest in some other form of ‘shiny objects’ that promises a quick fix. The truth is, just like for Magpie, the fix typically isn’t going to be quick if it is to be sustained.

For example, learning leadership skills is a journey that never really ends. Just like any journey it is accomplished one step at a time, some of which are simple while some land the traveler in a pothole or causes her to trip over hurdles in the road. Every time she falls, though, she is given the opportunity to pick herself up, wipe the dust off, and keep moving forward with new knowledge and capabilities. If she has a guide to help her along her road, as Alice does in Wonderland Odyssey, then they can help her avoid some of the pitfalls and prepare for the ones that she is sure to encounter.

This is a cautionary tale to remind us all that real, meaningful changes happen over time and with patience and practice.
