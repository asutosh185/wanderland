_“ Alice was beginning to get the picture of Magpie’s world. She realized not only did Magpie have to repeat herself to be heard but everyone treated Magpie as if she was their own personal staff, which wasn’t very nice. The bird seemed to be fair game as a target for everyone at the company. Alice realized that she was guilty of the same bad behavior. Why not explain things to Magpie and listen to the HR manager’s story?”_

_Leadership in Wonderland, Chapter 12, “HR Cawing” _



Hello?

Have you ever had the experience that a salesperson you were speaking with wasn’t listening? That they had their own agenda? That they were on automatic pilot? Or, that they thought they knew what you wanted better than you did? How about, even worse, that they were “bullying you” into buying something? Did you resist their power pitch?

On the other hand, have you ever had the experience that a salesperson you were speaking with made you feel as if you were the most important person in the world to them at the particular moment? Did you feel that they acted as if you were telling them the most captivating story ever and they were totally enthralled? Did you feel as if they understood that you were the authority on your own tastes and preferences and that you were smart?

Which is the more pleasant experience? Which person would you feel compelled to buy from? Which salesperson would you be happy to buy from and recommend to friends and colleagues?

For me, I chose the second choice in salespeople. In fact, I won’t buy from the first one even if they put a lot of effort into the sale and are very hardworking, confident, erudite and convincing. I prefer that someone understand that they are trying to please me because I am the one who is buying and not the other way around; that they are selling to my needs only after they hear and understand what they are.

I worked with 8 real estate brokers, until I finally found one that listened to MY requirements, preferences, and budget. I was shown a lot of nice apartments, but they didn’t fit my criteria, they fit the broker’s criteria that they had for me. Thank you, Sandy Tannenbaum at Corcoran Group Real Estate, for listening. I was so happy and relieved to find you and work with you.

On a much smaller scale, recently, I went make-up shopping, asking sales associates/make-up artists at upscale department stores for suggestions on eye make-up. Two out of six of them listened: thank you in particular, however, to Jacqueline at MAC at Saks Fifth Avenue (on Fifth Avenue) for not only listening but supporting and encouraging my make-up application and experimentation. What Jacqueline did that was so earth shattering, she completely focused her attention on eye make-up – color, application, blending. Not foundation, blush, or lip gloss. She heard me. And what happened was I bought from her, will continue to buy from her and will recommend others to buy from her. And, I made an extra effort to praise her to the department manager.

What are you preferences and feelings about salespeople and co-workers? Do you want to work with others who respect you and listen to you even if they sometimes disagree or do you want to work with those who only have their own agenda and don’t have time or brain bandwidth to listen to you?
