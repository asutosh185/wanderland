In our last blog entry, Susan told a little bit about how trust played such an important role in our collaboration. Since we started this process, we’ve encountered others who have said that they tried to collaborate, but found it to be an unsatisfactory endeavor. We didn’t allow the disappointments of others deter us, however. After many months of working together, we can now look back and see how truly life-altering this experience has been for us. Not only did we enjoy the creative process, but it has sparked many other changes in our lives as well (a topic for another blog). So, what is the difference between our partnership and those that others have experienced? More importantly, how can our experience benefit you?

It would be lovely to think that the creative process just clicked with us because we are both amazing people (and humble too!). However, the recipe for success has a few more ingredients than that. If you are a consultant or have ever worked with one, you know that we tend to put things under a microscope in order to better understand them. That is, after all, how we are able to assist our clients. Since both Susan and I consult on the people side of organizations, we study what makes people tick. For example, why are some a good fit and others not? Consequently, it shouldn’t be surprising that we both wanted to understand why our collaboration was so successful. We became our own lab rats in order that we could learn from our own experience so that others could benefit from it.  After much pondering on this matter, we came to a conclusion…We simply followed our own advice.
Let me draw a picture for you to help you understand…
[![Hierarchy of Organizational Needs](http://wonderlandodyssey.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/hierarchy-for-survey.jpg?w=265)](http://wonderlandodyssey.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/hierarchy-for-survey.jpg)
This is the Hierarchy of Organizational Needs. My company created it to help clients understand how to develop the most effective teams. The principle works wherever two or more people are working together to accomplish something.

To begin with, each person must be committed to _**communicating**_ with the others involved. As Susan talked about in the last blog, we were very mindful of how we treated one another at all times. While we didn’t always agree (otherwise what would have been the point of collaborating?) we did respect one another’s points of view. We also recognized that what was good communication for one of us, might not be for the other. With this in mind, we were able to eliminate the stumbling blocks that many people encounter when trying to work with others, especially in a creative endeavor.

Our open, honest and respectful communication allowed us to build a level of _**trust**_, the next level of the Hierarchy, which permitted us to be effective collaborators. As we have talked with others for whom collaboration was less than successful, we learned that many of the issues arose because there was a lack of trust. This can take the form of being defensive of one’s own ideas/work and a myriad of other symptoms that can spell disaster for a team no matter the size or project.

The next step on the Hierarchy is _**alignment**_. Simply put this means that the members of the team are all working for the same outcome. Susan and I, like every team, struggled with this from time to time. Sometimes, we had different visions, other times, one or both of us didn’t have a clear outcome in mind. You can see how this could spell disaster to any type of team. Luckily, we were able to overcome this potential barrier. Ultimately, we were both more concerned about “Alice” than we were about having our own agenda fulfilled. That is the true power of alignment.

When a team brings together effective communication and trust and they are committed to the same goal, they can achieve anything. That brings us to the top of the Hierarchy: _**Productivity**_. This is more than how many widgets are being created or how many hamburgers are being sold. It is about how the individuals involved come together as an effective team in order to do things better so that the outcomes are improved. As we worked together, our process evolved. When we started, we didn’t know much about one another’s creativity or style. As we learned and honed our process, it became increasingly smooth…and more and more enjoyable.

Tell us about your experiences in collaborating. What worked or didn’t work. We would love to hear from you!!
