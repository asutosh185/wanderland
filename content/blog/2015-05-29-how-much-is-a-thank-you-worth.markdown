We talk with many businesses concerned about improving sales and revenue. They often invest in expensive products and services thinking that they hold the magic ticket to success. Yet, sometimes it is something very small - seemingly insignificant - that can make all the difference.

In out last blog we told the story of a retail clerk who didn't know how to respond when a customer said she hadn't found everything she was looking for. A lost opportunity for customer service.

Shortly after that incidence, a friend recounted a story that was really baffling. It seems that on a Monday he put a $100 bill in his pocket with the intention of giving it to the first cashier who said thank you to him. He went about his business, visiting numerous stores over the next few day. Amazingly, as of Thursday of that week, the $100 was still in his pocket.

"The closest anyone anyone has come to saying 'thank you' is to say 'Have a nice day,'"he reported, pulling the prize money out of his pocket.

Really?

How important is it to you to be thanked for your business? Are those serving the public using different means to show their appreciation? Or is it more of a case that they don't really care?

What are your thoughts on this?
