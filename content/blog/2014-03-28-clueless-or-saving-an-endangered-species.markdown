_“Yes, as I told you, I am Alice, the founder.”
“Alice, the founder of what?  Alice, the founder of what?”
“Alice, the founder of Leaves-of-Wonderland! “.
“THE ALICE?”  Magpie squawked
“The very same!” said the girl, proudly.  
“I thought she wasn’t a real person.  Not real.  I thought she was a part of company legend.   Company legend.  A myth. A fairy tale. That’s what Hatter taught me to believe.  Hatter taught me to believe”.

Leadership in Wonderland, Chapter 12 “HR Cawing”_



Are you familiar with the book “Through the Looking Glass, And What Alice Found There”?  Do you know what a looking glass is?  It’s a mirror. Mirrors are universal objects; almost everyone owns at least one.  Do you know what a magnifying glass is?  Or perhaps you call it a hand lens?  Do you recognize the inspiration for the “search” icon on many websites?  

If you think about it, it’s marvelous how different people can view the same item from a completely different perspective depending on their backgrounds and history.  Taking the magnifying glass as a perfect example…..
A real magnifying glass was used as a prop at one of my public speaking classes.  The seasoned professionals in the class of course knew what it was.  The younger folk looked at it in awe, or perhaps disbelief.  “You mean you actually own a real magnifying glass?!”   (Yes, “Virginia”, “There really are magnifying glasses.  They really do exist.” comes to mind.)

I was surprised that the younger professionals had never seen one before and didn’t quite know what it was.  The question asked by THAT group was:  “Why have one?  Everything you could possibly want to see, you can use the viewing option to expand or make bigger at any time.”  

The more seasoned folk remembering what life was like before smart-phones,  and not thinking of telescopes, binoculars or microscopes, responded:  “What about something that isn’t one dimensional and on a computer, tablet or smart-phone screen?  For instance, can you imagine, choosing a diamond for an engagement ring without being able to see its facets.  What about if you are trying to look at something that isn’t static and you can’t control its movement?  Can you imagine looking at an insect without one?  Can you imagine a detective, not being able to look at clues in blood, fingerprints, or minute scenarios?  Obviously you’ve never watched Neil Cafferty on “White Collar” examine art work, jewels, money, printed documents,  etc.  Looking for a needle in a haystack, you need one.  And, of course there are the upscale restaurants that keep mini versions of magnifying glasses so that those with failing farsightedness can read the menu.  And how can you read the fine print on a prescription without one?  Sometimes reading glasses just don’t do the trick; you need something with much higher magnification.”

Yes, magnifying glasses do exist, many people own them and they do have a purpose.  They may even come to your rescue at some point in life.  I, for one, hope they’ll still be around at that time and it will be interesting as time passes, how one’s perspective can change.
