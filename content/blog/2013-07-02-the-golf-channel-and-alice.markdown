I’ve always been a big sports fan.  I’ve always loved the faster games:  football, tennis, basketball, hockey, yet, I’ve been less enthusiastic about the slower games:  baseball and golf.   I’ve never used a golf club (except at a driving range) while I’ve thrown a football, held a racket, played hoops, and run with a hockey stick.  Yet, here I am at the ripe old age of… say, over 40, and I find myself all of a sudden drawn to watching The Golf Channel.  I like to watch the swings, the clothes, the sportsmanship, the relationship between the caddie and the pro, and I can appreciate the strategy, the rules, the greens, the layout of the courses, the constantly changing leaderboard, and the pars, birdies and bogies. Why?

It is a sport that seems to me to be a great equalizer.   No one gets preferential treatment (maybe, Tiger Woods that one time, but….).  Everyone knows the rules and plays by the rules.  There’s no fighting, pushing, fouling, name-calling, in fact, there’s only respect for one another.  There are no tantrums or entitlements. The guidelines in pros are the same as the tenets in amateur, high school, college, etc.  There’s no mandatory retirement because there’s always the seniors. The fans aren’t unruly, don’t throw things on the course, don’t hurt each other or abuse each other, and there’s no close-ups by the media of celebrity fans.  It combines a wonderful duo of strategy and skill.   The simplicity of the game itself is also appealing:  the person with the smallest amount of strokes wins.  

Wouldn’t it be nice if all businesses could function like the sport of golf with the same rules for all?  No preferential treatment by the media, courts, banks, SEC, IRS, insurance companies, government, etc because of size, name, longevity, celebrity endorsements, and on and on.   Everyone can succeed regardless of background, age, gender.  There’s a sense of fair play and a lack of politics.  Well, I can dream, can’t I?

Alice, our “It Girl” in our book “Wonderland Odyssey”, explains that she had left “Leaves of Wonderland”, her tea business, to retreat to a world of fun and games: a world which had standardized instructions and winners who won from following those instructions.  Yet, at the beginning of the book she returns to manage her business because she realizes fantasy and rulebooks only exist “on the golf course” and have no place in the world of business.  She would always have her pastimes (where did that word come from, anyway?) but she couldn’t escape the fact that she had a responsibility to managing the business she started.

Business is a world of cowboys constantly changing the rules and charting uncharted territory.   However, golf is a great counterpart for escape in simplicity and safety when the business world comes crashing in on us.  Even Alice understood, like all of us do, sometimes you need your counterpart to the rest of life when and where everything makes sense to balance what does not.
