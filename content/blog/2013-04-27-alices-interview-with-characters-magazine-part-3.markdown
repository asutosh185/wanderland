Recently we featured the first and second installments of the interview of Alice Liddell, owner of Leaves-of-Wonderland: Purveyor of Fine Teas, by Mark Cohiba contributor to “Characters” magazine. Below is our 3rd and final installment of the interview……

A:   You would love to know the company’s name?  What a scoop, right?!  Sorry.  I’m not telling, Mark. Luckily, we’ve been able to keep them at bay, and I have an arsenal of Legal Eagles at my beck and call if need be.  We are perched, waiting to see if the foreign competitor will tilt its hand further.  So far the atmosphere is calm.
C:  Again, you’re taking the fifth. That’s too bad, our readers and Wall Street analysts would love to hear of a nasty battle.
A:  Yes, I know. Sorry to disappoint you.
C: So, Madam CEO, you’re not getting out of here so quickly.  You opened up the door to another angle. How did it get to the point that a competitor was “chomping at the bit” and your fellow employees were “dangling the carrot” for them to seize?
A:  Well, well…
C:  Yes!  I see I’ve got you!  You can’t slide down the rabbit hole this time.
A:  Ha! I don’t need to go down the rabbit hole. You could say it all comes down to a simple lack of communication.
C: Simple!  Hardly, I’m sure!
A: But it is a simple answer. I stopped paying attention to my business. I left “Leaves” to  the real executive types to pursue more suitable childhood pastimes. I didn’t know how a young girl was going to continue to run a growing business. I didn’t think I was really qualified for that sort of thing. I thought I had hired the right individuals to manage it. I thought they were much better qualified. I thought they would …
C: .. But instead those qualified individuals decided on a different tactic – to sell the business to a foreign entity that was thirsty for an easy entry into the English tea drinking business.  Those managers who you hired didn’t want to work to grow your business, they…
A:   Excuse me, Mark.  I don’t know that.  I don’t know how they got to the point in time that they were discussing the sale of “Leaves” to this competitor, but I’d like to think at least initially they had my best interest in mind.
C:  so the sale was one of your options that you left them?!
A:  No, I didn’t say that! It was just a misunderstanding due to lack of communication on my part.
C:  So then, they were just lazy and greedy. Do tell us more….
A:  Oh, dear me!  I do apologize, I didn’t notice the time. I have an appointment with Rebecca and Susan. Must run.  We should do this again some time.

The interview concluded as quickly as it started.  Do you have a better understanding of our star, Alice, or is she still an enigma?  Read about her adventures in “The Wonderland Odyssey: Turning Leadership on its Hat” and come to your own conclusion.
