_"I’m just a girl, and even though I am a smart girl, should I know all of these things? Am I really ready and equipped to run a company? What was I thinking?”_

I can relate to what Alice is feeling. Can you?

Once I was asked to sit on the newly formed Corporate Advisory Council for a not-for-profit organization. I felt honored to be invited to participate, and a little overwhelmed by the credentials of the others in the room. When I was asked to serve as the chairman of this newly formed council, my head swam. I had the impulse to yell “No, you don’t want me! I don’t have the experience/knowledge/personality/ability to perform this important task.”

As it happens, I just sat there quietly (hard to believe, I know) in a state of shock as the other members elected me to this position for which I felt so unqualified to hold.

I felt like an imposture – a fake.

As it turned out, I was capable of leading the council, and we helped the organization grow and positively impact the lives of people nationwide.

So, maybe I wasn’t such an imposture.

Nevertheless, it took time for me to overcome that feeling, just as it does Alice. For the longest time, I thought I was the only one to feel like a fake, but it turns out that it’s common.

In fact, some estimates say that upwards of 70% of people experience this feeling known as the _Imposture Syndrome_.

Those with imposture syndrome are unable to internalize their own successes – often attributing them to external factors such as luck or timing. Sometimes they think they’ve pulled the wool over other people’s eyes, never quite feeling like they deserve the success they’ve achieved.

Someone asked me how I overcame feeling like a fraud. My answer: SLOWLY. I did my best, and helped others to achieve success along the way.

How about you? Have you ever experienced imposture syndrome? If so, how did you handle it?
