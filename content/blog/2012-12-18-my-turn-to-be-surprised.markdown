I’ve been surprised by you all, who wouldn’t ordinarily be excited about a business book with connections to a children’s story.  I see it!  Your eyes light up, not when I’m discussing the theme of the book, but when you hear a snippet of Rebecca and my story and you are fascinated by our writing process.  “How could you spend a year committed to something without knowing the other person involved?  How could you know that your writing styles were similar?  How could you know that you both would be committed throughout the whole process until the book was finished?   “How could you create that kind of collaboration?”  One word:  Trust.  Rebecca and I trusted each other and we trusted in our process. 

We had spent a year or more on a consistent basis getting to know each other over the phone.  We discovered we were simpatico.  We thought strategically, we analyzed, and yet we always brought a very human element, perhaps emotional intelligence, to our work and our discussions.  We spoke easily and openly without a fear that we were going to be judged.  We built a trust that was firmly planted and never questioned, so when we discussed writing a book together, it wasn’t a very scary proposition; in fact, it was almost, “Of course, we’ll write a book!”  We figured if it doesn’t work, then it doesn’t work, but it will be worth a try.

We were both passionately committed to the progress of our work and we fed on each other’s ideas, words, and emotions.   We held each other accountable to deadlines and to keeping to the same style, ideas, chapter themes, characterizations.  We encouraged each other and were each other’s best supporters and motivators.  We would never say an unkind word to each other or criticize.  But we did offer suggestions.  Lots of them.  We wanted our work to be authentic and the best it possibly could be.

So now my question to all of you, who may not have thought about it, how can you do business with a partner, a client, a vendor, a coach, a mentor or anyone else without assuming a feeling of trust?  Perhaps it’s something you don’t question because it’s a given and assumed.  Can you actually collaborate or work with someone you don’t trust?
