        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <p>Playing the game, opens participants to possibilities, unlocks whatever has
          been holding them back and stimulates their creativity for those real life
          challenges. This is a workshop, yet it is also a competition and a game.</p>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>It is far easier to see, problem-solve and manage challenges when they don’t
          affect you directly. This is the reason that we wrote "Leadership In Wonderland"
          as fiction. If you can recognize challenges and provide solutions for a
          fictional company, you then feel confident in using those same skills in
          problem-solving for your own business circumstances. Playing the game,
          opens participants to possibilities, unlocks whatever has been holding
          them back and stimulates their creativity for those real life challenges.
          This is a workshop, yet it is also a competition and a game.</p>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>When we leave Alice and friends at the end of Leadership in Wonderland, she
          is faced with an uncertain future. She has developed credibility as CEO
          of Leaves-of-Wonderland, but she desperately needs to fix the company or
          it will be sold to a crafty competitor.</p>
        <p>There are six complex and interrelated problems that must be solved for the
          company’s future to be on more solid ground. This workshop will define
          the problems and offer solutions for each one, including Hatter, Queen
          and the Board’s potential influence on the solution.</p>
        <p>These responses will then be compared against other groups’ during the course
          of a year. When we reconvene in a year’s time, the best solutions for each
          issue will be presented from all those given. Then a discussion will evolve
          to see if it is possible to weave the winning solutions together to provide
          the solid ground Alice needs. When they are all able to be integrated,
          the authors will be positioned to write the “Leadership in Wonderland”
          sequel. Therefore, all participants will join us in trying to create the
          sequel to the book.</p>
        <h3>Details:</h3>
        <h5>First Session:</h5>
        <p>Through a guided process, participants as a whole, will identify the six
          problems. Then breakout sessions, each focused entirely on solving one
          of the six, will develop their own response and solution, for that specific
          problem including how and if Hatter, Queen and the Board might intervene.
          These six solutions and scenarios will be presented to the group as a whole.</p>
        <h5>Second Session:</h5>
        <p>After a year, we will meet again to revisit the group of the solutions they
          had offered in the competition, and to present the best to each challenge
          that we, the authors, chose from all those entered during the course of
          the competition. The next step, we will discuss as a group whether or not
          we can make an integrated plan for Alice from the winning individual solutions
          so that she can put her company back on track. Will the storyline come
          together?</p>
        <br>
        <p>The individuals responsible for each solution used in the actual sequel will
          be acknowledged in the book itself.</p>
