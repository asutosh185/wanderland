        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <p>Participants will be introduced to many concepts that will help the team

          behaviors, attitudes and activities into those that are productive.</p>
        <h3>Workshop Objectives :</h3>
        <p>Alice learned quickly that her team was integral to the success of Leaves-of-Wonderland.
          This workshop is designed to help both leaders and team members make a
          positive impact on the success of their organization by implementing some
          of Alice’s lessons. Participants will be introduced to many concepts that
          will help the team develop better communication and cohesiveness to turn
          counter-productive behaviors, attitudes and activities into those that
          are productive. From there it examines how to raise the level of trust,
          and ensure there is alignment to goals and objectives, all of which are
          foundational to improving productivity. The workshop also discusses qualities
          that can be groomed in everyone so they are more effective within their
          sphere of influence, and how they impact the organization.</p>
        <p>The desired outcomes for this course is a more engaged team with better understanding
          of the "big picture", and to arm participants with tool that will allow
          them to make a positive impact on the future of the organization. The workshop
          is conducted in concert with a diagnostic, Team Performance Map™, which
          helps participants understand the cause and effect of various attitudes,
          activities and behaviors, and guides them in creating a custom roadmap
          for their desired enhancements.</p>
